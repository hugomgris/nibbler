## 8.1 Day Eight Plan
Today the 2D realm will be done task-wise. For it, the following needs to happen:
- Particles spray when eating
- Some animation of the food
	- Maybe regarding the spawning (tunneling?, which would mean I'd have to animate the spawning in 3D too, though)
- Think about if the snake is going to be a solid stripe of plain color, or if some effects are to be put in place
	- I'd like to add some print-like texturing, but that might be hard (or too much of a hustle regarding the taks turn in)

Some other things that I'd like to tackle today:
- Make sure that the 3D rendering in Raylib is always completely inside and centered in the game window (specially check big arenas)
- See if the `Ncurses` rendering can be done in a floating window/terminal, i.e. dettaching it from the main console from which the game is ran
- Implement a pause button (spacebar)

## 8.2 Some More Thinking on the Walk
This morning, while commuting and having my morning walk, I thought that **refocusing the mental ideal of what this game could be around the notion of `beads` could be a good idea**. From *Nido* to *Rosario*, building a game based on snake body modules (and heads) with effects/abilities/etc. Trying to build *from* there, starting in a pure gameplay oriented prototype and see what it could lead to. 
 > all of this while having a hundred other projects in my head, all fighting for some attention. Well, at least the idea is there...
