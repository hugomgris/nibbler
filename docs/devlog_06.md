## 6.1 Day Six Plan
Monday again, the sadness persists, and so does the work. I'll pick it up just where I left it last Friday: **searching for an Ncurses substitute**. Besides that, some other things that could be done today:
- Refine the food spawning
- Start menu
- Refine the ending processsing
- Start experimenting with the `3D version` (cube-based) in Raylib
