## 11.1 Day Eleven Plan
A considerable chunk of today's working time has gone towards job applications, so I don't think there will be great advancements today. Still, there are a couple of hours left on the workclock, so let's put them to good use. Today's plan doesn't need a list, as it is quite straight forward: **working on the start and gameover screens** across platforms.

## 11.2 The Graphic Gardens of Eden
Snake, apple... Eden vibes, right? Whatever, there's design work to do...

First, let's try to finish the `NCurses` implementations by redesigning the gameover screens, both for small and large formats. I'll just reuse what I wrote for the start screen and use it to also draw the ending statuses. Here they are:
